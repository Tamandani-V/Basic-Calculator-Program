# Simple Functional Calculator in Python

## Overview
This is a beginner-friendly command-line calculator program written in Python. It performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program interacts with the user through the console, allowing them to select an operation, input numbers, and get the result. It also handles invalid inputs gracefully.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions
- Input validation to ensure numeric input
- Division by zero error handling
- Loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting the program
- Clear and simple user interface with prompts and results

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- Any code editor or IDE that supports Python (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm)
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts from the terminal or command line

## How to Run
1. Save the calculator program code in a file named `calculator.py` (or any filename with a `.py` extension).
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved using `cd` command.
4. Run the script by typing:
   ```
   python calculator.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and enter numbers.
6. Perform as many calculations as you want. Type `no` when asked if you want another calculation to exit.

## Code Structure
- The program defines four arithmetic functions — `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()` — each taking two numbers and returning the calculation result.
- The main `calculator()` function handles user interaction, input validation, and calls the correct arithmetic function based on user choice.
- The program uses a loop to allow continuous use until the user decides to quit.

## Sample Interaction
```
Welcome to the simple calculator!
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice (1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
Do you want to perform another calculation? (yes/no): no
Thank you for using the calculator. Goodbye!
```
